# Magic Context

Re-usable prompts and prompt templates for AI coding projects. This repository collects good context patterns for AI development to improve code generation, debugging, and project automation.

## Purpose

This project serves as a knowledge base of proven prompt patterns, context templates, and AI interaction strategies that can be reused across different coding projects. The goal is to standardize and share effective AI prompting techniques for software development.

## Structure

- `blender-plugin/` - Prompts and templates specific to Blender plugin development
- `general/` - Universal prompts that can be used across any programming project

## Usage

Each directory contains markdown files with prompt templates, context patterns, and usage examples. These can be copied and adapted for specific projects or used as reference for creating new AI interactions.

## Contributing

Add new prompt patterns by creating markdown files in the appropriate directories. Include clear examples and usage instructions for each pattern.
