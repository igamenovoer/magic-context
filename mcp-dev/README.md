# MCP Development Resources

This directory contains reusable guides and resources for Model Context Protocol (MCP) development.

## Contents

### `howto-call-mcp-servers-programmatically.md`
A comprehensive, framework-agnostic guide for calling MCP servers programmatically using Python. Covers three tested approaches:

1. **MCP CLI Tools (Recommended)** - Official protocol implementation
2. **Direct TCP Socket Connection** - Low-level access for custom protocols  
3. **Direct Tool Import (FastMCP only)** - Development testing approach

**Key Features:**
- Generic examples applicable to any MCP server
- Best practices for production use
- Testing and debugging strategies
- Error handling patterns
- Performance considerations

## Usage

These guides are designed to be:
- **Framework-agnostic** - Work with any MCP implementation
- **Reusable** - Copy/adapt for different projects
- **Comprehensive** - Cover common development scenarios
- **Production-ready** - Include error handling and best practices

## Contributing

When adding new MCP development resources:
- Keep guides generic and reusable
- Include working code examples
- Document both success and error scenarios
- Follow consistent formatting
- Test all approaches before documenting
