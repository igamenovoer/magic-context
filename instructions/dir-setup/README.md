# Directory Setup Instructions

This subdirectory contains instructions that specify **where to place generated files** and **directory structure conventions** for organizing project documentation and artifacts.

## Files in this directory

- **make-architect-doc.md** - Architecture documentation → `context/design/`
- **make-backlog.md** - Backlog task items → `context/tasks/backlog/`
- **make-hint.md** - How-to guides and hints → `context/hints/`
- **make-project-summary.md** - Project summaries → `context/summaries/`
- **make-refactor-plan.md** - Refactoring plans → `context/tasks/refactor/`
- **make-roadmap.md** - Feature roadmaps → `context/plans/roadmaps/`
- **save-command.md** - Saved commands → `context/tasks/auto-save/`

## Purpose

These instructions establish consistent conventions for:
- File naming patterns
- Directory organization
- Document structure
- Metadata requirements

Following these conventions ensures that AI assistants and developers can easily locate, create, and maintain project documentation in a predictable structure.
