you are tasked to write python code that is directly runnable interactively in shell or jupyter notebook, so:

- do not include any `if __name__ == "__main__":` guards
- prefer to use top-level code, avoid wrapping in functions unless necessary, users will want to inspect and modify variables
- anticipate jupyter notebook environments, avoid code that would conflict with notebook cells (e.g., avoid re-defining variables in the same cell)
