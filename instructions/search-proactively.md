you are tasked to write code with APIs that you are not familiar with, follow these guidelines

# Guidelines for Proactively Searching for Information
- if you encounter problems or are unsure about how to use a specific API or library, proactively search for relevant information online
- try to use `context7` to find documentations if you encouter problems calling 3rd python library, or if you think needed or in doubt
- if `context7` does not provide sufficient information, use online search engines to find official documentation, tutorials, or examples
- ALWAYS look for official documentation first if you encouter problem related to 3rd party libraries, unless the docs are already searched for previously, or the user specifically asked not to.
