you are tasked to do something with code, libraries, packages or tools that you may not be familiar with, so you need to find online information about it if not sure

# Guidelines for finding online information

- check your context, if you have not searched for documentation yet, do so before you act.
- if the source code of the tool or library is available in `<workspace>/context` dir (usually in `refcode/` subdir), or given in the prompt, check them first.
- for coding tools, libraries, or packages, look for documentation from `context7` mcp first
- if not found, look for official documentation or trusted sources online
- always find some latest examples or usage guides
