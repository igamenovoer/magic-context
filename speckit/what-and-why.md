you are asked to rewrite a block of text or a given file (called them `target-text`), into paragraph about what is the thing that is described by the `target-text`, and why the described things are important, what are the purpose and goals.

## Guidelines
- The output should be a single paragraph, no bullets or lists.
- The paragraph begins with a bolded title **(name-of-the-thing)**, then followed by a colon, then the explanation.
